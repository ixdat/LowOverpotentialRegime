This is for miscellaneous scripts for processing raw data and inserting results into
the project tables.
Since the tables were already generated when we started the LowOverpotentialRegime

https://github.com/ScottSoren/pyOER20/tree/master/data_processing for the scripts we
used to generate the tables.
