Otherwise good calibration\n\n03... wrong settings\n\n04... no CO strip. Also, no sign of surface exchange with O2 dosing.\n\nChip has held up surprisingly long. So has isotope ratio. And I didn't even fill the bong tips with isotope\nwater. How can this be?\n\npacking up, chip hydrophillic but passes an extra drop test.\n\nScott out.</pre></td></tr>\n"
