It seems COox happens in a window\nthat's anodic of the reduciton of Pt that's been oxidized at 100 uA for 5 minutes... There is an overlap, but\nholy shit it's small.\nRE_vs_RHE is 0.717, close enough to the 0.715 V I've been assuming (and will continue to assume)\nwow, collected electrolyte a total of 10 times during that.\n\n02...\n\n10 min is not long enough at 100 uA to get stable OER on Evans!\nActivity testing accidentally repeated the most anodic point a lot of times first.\nCollected electrolyte thrice: OCP (before the 10 min at 100 uA), after 10 min at 100 uA, and at the end (after\nactivity testing)</pre></td></tr>\n"
