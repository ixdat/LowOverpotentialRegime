Finally mounted 2500s in. \nAir signal way to high (factor approx 3). Don't know why. I want it down. \n\n02... 5mv/s scan up to 0.184 vs RE, 1.570 vs RHE, then 2-minute hold. Looks good.\n\n03... Internal calibrations starting 4700s: 50uA, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1uA\n\nChip SI07 breached in the end (6400s) after many hours in pH 12 and pH 13. Awesome chip.\nSI07 looks broken, may be reason air signal was high</pre></td></tr>\n"
