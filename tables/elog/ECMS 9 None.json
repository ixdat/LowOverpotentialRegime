SI07 looks broken, may be reason air signal was high earlier today.\nQMS timestamp 13:52:07\n\nLoadlock vented in N2, just like previous several samples in this project.\nO18 drop applied within about 15 seconds from opening of loadlock.\n\n04...\nDrop experiment goes fine, a bit less active than Scott09, may be isotope effect.\n\n05...\nECMS shows a lot of noise. Bubble observed in RE. Need more potential for good signal. Isotope effect can't\nexplain now that I'm in normal electrolyte.\n\n06...\nall internal calibrations at 5 uA/s\n\n07...\nremoved bubble from RE and tried CV's with hold at UPL again (same as 05..., but looking much better!)\n2 5 mV/s scans</pre></td></tr>\n"
