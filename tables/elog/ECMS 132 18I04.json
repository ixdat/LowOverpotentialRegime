Hope I didn't reduce surface.\n03...\nResistor on again at 500 Ohm. Gonna live with it. Dosed O2 while cycling, removed while at 1.2 V vs RHE, idea is\nto catch *(16)O(16)OH. \nTwo first cycles after have identical isotope ratios, still haven't seen O stripping!\nEnding and giving sample to Ejler.</pre></td></tr>\n"
