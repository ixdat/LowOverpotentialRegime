Exchange, or electrolyte sucks in H2O from air through Teflon tape?\n\n-------\nresistance for 01 and 02 and 03 of Reshma 1B = 300 ohm. CHanged to 100 Ohm for 04. Noisey potential drifts --\nchanged &lt;resistance to 500 in cycle 2 to see if any difference -- no difference so changed back to 100\n\n1.45 V gave high enough currents to cause amplifier overload! reduce the potential -- seems to work fine\n\nWE crocodile clip fell off. restarted scans in +5 file\n\nresistance for 1A maintained at 100 ohm\n\n\nResistor changed from 100 to 500 Ohm in cycle 48 of 18H31_Reshma1A/01...\ndidn't help with bump, but kept it for a bit anyway.\nAnd back to 100 during cycle 58.</pre></td></tr>\n"
