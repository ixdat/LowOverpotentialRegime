    "notes": "Once again, as seems to be the case with RuO2 films, the dominant CO2 on the first scan is m/z=44. Very interesting.\nHuge air signal in both drop test and measurement. I suspect crack or o-ring leak. However, CV looks good and I\nshould be able to get the faradaic efficiency measurement without it. If percent accuracy is needed, I can\ncalculate how much M32 there should be based on M36 and M34.\nActivity a bit less than the previous sample, which I suspect to have been a mis-labeled Reshma1D.\n\nNP's drying in the fume hood. I'm going to head home.\n\n\n--- 18I17 -----\nActivity test looking beautiful. Allowed to run until 12 hours completed. ~15% in O2 over entire run. However, the\ncurrent jumped at two locations, indicating shunt tilt. Indeed, the post-stability activity measurments show shunt. \n\nExhcnaged O in sample for 18O from electrolyte in three reps of 2 min at -0.05 V vs RHE and +1.45 V vs RHE. Then\nrepeated activity test. Same but for shunt tilt...\nThis sample, Reshma1F, will be given OER, without any reduction, in O16 tomorrow, and then given to Ejler for I.S.S.</pre></td></tr>\n"
