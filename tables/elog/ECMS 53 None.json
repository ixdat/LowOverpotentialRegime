It is cracked in such a way that there's only a leak to the capillary when\npressure is put on the chip by the cell. Just as seen last wednesday. I should have changed it. Instead I showed\nKoper that we sometimes can't do experiments because we crack chips...\nC3 has a clear problem at the carrier gas outlet. Trying anyway. MISTAKE. Floods the buffer volume.\nNew chip. </pre></td></tr>\n"
